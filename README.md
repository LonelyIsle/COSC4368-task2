## Description
This solver is designed to solve a set of problems (A, B, and C) by applying specific algorithms tailored to each problem. It generates solutions, computes the number of violated axioms (NVA), and outputs the results in a CSV file for further analysis.

## How to Run

To run the solver for each problem, use the following commands:

- **Problem A:**  
  `python solver.py --problem A`

- **Problem B:**  
  `python solver.py --problem B`

- **Problem C:**  
  `python solver.py --problem C`

Make sure you have Python installed and all required dependencies before running the solver.

## Output

After running the solver, you will get:

- The **solution** printed to the console or saved in an output file.
- The **number of violated axioms (NVA)** associated with the solution.
- A **CSV file** containing detailed results and metrics for the problem solved.
